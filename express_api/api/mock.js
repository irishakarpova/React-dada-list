The presentations took place in venues ranging from theaters and university auditoriums to dormitories and prisons. The group's actions were derided as 'literary hooliganism' in the ever-more conservative press of the late 1920s. It was chastised even more in the early 1930s, and many of its associates were arrested. The OBERIU has often been called 'the last Soviet avant-garde'."

The Russian avant-garde reached its creative and popular height in the period between the Russian Revolution of 1917 and 1932, at which point the ideas of the avant-garde clashed with the newly emerged state-sponsored direction of Socialist Realism."

Natalia Davidova, one of the founders and the head of the Kiev Folk Center, was an Avant-garde artist descended from the ancient Ukrainian Hudim-Levkovichis family (Russian philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev was her cousin and artist Nina Genke-Meller was his sister-in-law). The beginning of the cooperation of Natalia Davidova and Nina Genke-Meller originated not just from their family relations. They both were keen on folk art and were devoted to the idea of implementation of Avant-garde artistic principles into practice of amateur goods. In 1915 Nina Genke became a head and chief artist of Natalia's Davidova Folk Center in Verbovka village. N.Davidova involved Nina Genke in 'promoting' folk thing's production in accordance with the sketchers of famous Avant-garde artists. "

The association was started in 1923 by Nikolai Ladovsky, a teacher at VKhUTEMAS and member of INKhUK, along with other avant-garde architects such as Vladimir Krinsky. The group's researches were particularly influenced by the work of Hugo Münsterberg, and Ladovsky built a psychotechnical laboratory in 1926 based on Münsterberg's theory of industrial psychology. In general the group concentrated on creating 'psycho-organisational' effects (as Ladovsky put it) with architecture: a sculptural rather than functional approach, leading to accusations of 'formalism' by the nascent OSA Group. ASNOVA and OSA engaged in polemics over terminology and the claim to 'constructivism' "

      "location":"1913-1915",
      "description":"Universal Flowering (Mirovoi rastsvet) is the name given by Pavel Filonov to his system of analytical art. The system arose from cubo-futurist experiments and works that he undertook from 1913-1915. It is characterized by very dense, minutely facetted, and relatively flat surfaces created by working from the particular to the general, using the smallest of brushes and the sharpest of pencils. The images have both Cubism's multiple vantage points and Futurism's representation of a figure over time. A number of the paintings, while having a given orientation, are painted as though they could be oriented in a variety of ways. Filonov's philosophy was originally formalized in written form in 1915, which was revised and published as The Declaration of Universal Flowering in 1923 when Filonov was a professor at the (then) Petrograd Academy of Arts. Filonov's main theoretical work The Ideology of Analytical Art (Ideologia analiticheskogo iskusstva) was published in 1930."

The presentations took place in venues ranging from theaters and university auditoriums to dormitories and prisons. The group's actions were derided as 'literary hooliganism' in the ever-more conservative press of the late 1920s. It was chastised even more in the early 1930s, and many of its associates were arrested. The OBERIU has often been called 'the last Soviet avant-garde'."

The Russian avant-garde reached its creative and popular height in the period between the Russian Revolution of 1917 and 1932, at which point the ideas of the avant-garde clashed with the newly emerged state-sponsored direction of Socialist Realism."

Natalia Davidova, one of the founders and the head of the Kiev Folk Center, was an Avant-garde artist descended from the ancient Ukrainian Hudim-Levkovichis family (Russian philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev was her cousin and artist Nina Genke-Meller was his sister-in-law). The beginning of the cooperation of Natalia Davidova and Nina Genke-Meller originated not just from their family relations. They both were keen on folk art and were devoted to the idea of implementation of Avant-garde artistic principles into practice of amateur goods. In 1915 Nina Genke became a head and chief artist of Natalia's Davidova Folk Center in Verbovka village. N.Davidova involved Nina Genke in 'promoting' folk thing's production in accordance with the sketchers of famous Avant-garde artists. "
